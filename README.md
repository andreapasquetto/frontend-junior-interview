## What are we asking you to do

Replicate this UI:

![Final result](assets/result.png)

When the **remove** button is clicked, the user thumbnail should disappear.
This feature is to be done with javascript.

Inside `src/index.php` you will find a base html template, with a `User` object already loaded.

You are free to use any css and js frameworks you want.

### Bonus 1
Make the UI responsive, handling both tablet and smartphone.
